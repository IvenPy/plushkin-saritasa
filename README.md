### Rationale
#### Ever encountered this situation once in your life?

>Itâ€™s a very often problem that you have some duplications of files in your file system. Some of us can collect a lot of stuff like images or PDF-books and so on. And sometimes there can be several copies of the same file with difference in names. 

#### This is not a problem anymore.

We are glad to introduce you a tool which can help you to clean your folders and remove all duplicates.
Don't worry, this is not that type of an app, that will erase everything from your computer.
We will **gently ask you** whether do you want to delete all this *SECRETIMAGEOFNUDEKATEFROMPARTY.img* copies stored in different folders (~~for safety reasons of course~~) or not. 
Just provide plushkin.py with a directory path to find and you'll know if there are any garbage duplicates saved for the rainy day or everything is clean and fresh.

### How do I use it?

It is very simple. Like a piece of cake.

```python3 plushkin.py /path/to/my/folder```

#### or you can do this (in case you in the directory you want to start analyse)
```python3 plushkin.py .```

See? That's very simple
However, if you feel confident about Kate's photoes, try **this**

```python3 plushkin.py /path/to/folder -d```

This will start an interactive command line user interface and will help you to keep Kate's photoes were they stored
